# DrawingTagger
A program to tag or label a part of a drawing. The drawing file is generated from TRACE software by Dr. Peter Cheng.

The bare minimum of the file consists of an indicator ```<<Extracted_Lines>>``` followed by the line coordinates. The format for the line coordinates are as follows:
```
<ID>,<X_START>,<X_END>,<Y_START>,<Y_END>,<TIME_START>,<TIME_END>,<TAG>
```
- ID - line ID number.
- X_START - x-value of starting coordinate of the line
- X_END - x-value of ending coordinate of the line
- Y_START - y-value of starting coordinate of the line
- Y_END - y-value of ending coordinate of the line
- TIME_START - the time when the line started to be drawn
- TIME_END - the time when the line ends
- TAG - (Optional) the tag or label for the line generated by this program

An example of TRACE file would have at least the following:
```
<<Extracted_Lines>>
