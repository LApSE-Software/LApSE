# LApSE
The Protocol Annotation System (LApSE) is a software to tag or label a part of a drawing. The drawing file is generated from TRACE software by Dr. Peter Cheng.

### Binary download
Will be available soon.

### Building from source
LApSE uses Log4J 2 for its logging system. Therefore, you need to download Log4J 2 binary from [here](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html), and then add the dependencies listed below to the project:
- log4j-api-2.3.jar
- log4j-core-2.3.jar

### File format
The bare minimum of the file consists of an indicator ```<<Extracted_Lines>>``` followed by the line coordinates. The format for the line coordinates are as follows:
```
<ID>,<X_START>,<X_END>,<Y_START>,<Y_END>,<TIME_START>,<TIME_END>,<TAG>
```
- ID - line ID number.
- X_START - x-value of starting coordinate of the line
- X_END - x-value of ending coordinate of the line
- Y_START - y-value of starting coordinate of the line
- Y_END - y-value of ending coordinate of the line
- TIME_START - the time when the line started to be drawn
- TIME_END - the time when the line ends
- TAG - (Optional) the tag or label for the line generated by LApSE
